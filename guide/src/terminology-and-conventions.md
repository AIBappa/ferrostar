# Terminology and Conventions

In this guide, we have very specific definitions of certain terms,
noted below.
Cases where a more narrow interpretation is needed should be obvious.

* **Interface** - When used in a context that’s talking about code,
  we use this term to mean a method or type signature.
  For example, we will use the term interface to refer to Kotlin interfaces,
  Swift protocols, and Rust traits.
  We also use the term to refer to a type’s *public interface*
  as in the available properties to an end user such as yourself.
* **Kotlin** - We’ll be quite loose when talking about “Kotlin.”
  It would be too cumbersome to write out something like Kotlin/Java or
  “your favorite JVM language.”
  When we speak of Kotlin, we usually mean any JVM language,
  except when referring to specific Kotlin features.
  While all example code is in Kotlin,
  things should work equally well in Java.
* **Platform** - When we refer to “platform libraries”, the “platform layer”,
  similar, we are referring to code written for/targeting
  the end deployment platform directl (ex: iOS, Android, etc.).
