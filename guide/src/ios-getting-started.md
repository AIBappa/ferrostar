# Getting Started on iOS

This section of the guide covers how to integrate Ferrostar into an iOS app.
We'll cover the "batteries included" approach, but flag areas for customization and overrides along the way.

TODO

## Add the Swift package dependency

## Configure location services

### Permissions and privacy strings

### Location providers

## Configure the `FerrostarCore` instance

## OPTIONAL: Configure the core delegate

## Using the NavigationMapView

## Demo app

We've put together a minimal [demo app](https://github.com/stadiamaps/ferrostar/tree/main/apple/DemoApp) with an example integration.
