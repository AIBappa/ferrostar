# Ferrostar

Ferrostar is a FOSS navigation SDK built from the ground up for the future.

[Why a new SDK?](https://stadiamaps.notion.site/Next-Gen-Navigation-SDK-f16f987bfa5a455296b0671636033cdb)

## Current status

The project is under active development, but rapidly approaching beta.
The core is quite functional.
iOS is in a fairly solid beta state, and Android sholud be beta quality soon!

While there are some rough edges, eager developers can start integrating.
Note that the API is currently NOT stable and there will still be some breaking changes,
but the release notes should include details.
