# Ferrostar

Ferrostar is a FOSS navigation SDK built from the ground up for the future.

[Why a new SDK?](https://stadiamaps.notion.site/Next-Gen-Navigation-SDK-f16f987bfa5a455296b0671636033cdb)

## Current status

The project is under active development.
Many parts of the design are still in flux,
so there are no API stability guarantees.

That said, things are now in a solid alpha state,
and rapidly approaching beta for iOS (Android UI is slightly behind).
While there are some rough edges, eager developers can start testing.
