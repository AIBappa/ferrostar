# Ferrostar Core

Ferrostar is a next-gen FOSS navigation SDK built from the ground up from the accumulated learnings
of working with existing SDKs.

For more details about the architecture of the project, refer to the [repository](https://github.com/stadiamaps/ferrostar).
This crate is the common core which can be used to power turn-by-turn navigation experiences on a
variety of platforms.
